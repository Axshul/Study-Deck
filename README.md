# Study-Deck (example)

This repository is a small example workspace scaffold for study materials.

Structure created:

- `Subjects/` — top-level subject folders (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry)
	- `Mathematics/Notes/` — example notes (`algebra.md`, `geometry.md`)
	- `Mathematics/Videos/` — placeholder folder for videos
	- `subject.json` files in each subject folder with placeholder "Subject N" display names
- `assets/` — icons, images, and other static assets
- `data/manifest.json` — small manifest listing created files
- `index.html` — placeholder Canva AI generated desk interface
- `LICENSE` — MIT license (placeholder)

Notes:
- Subject display names are placeholders: "Subject 1", "Subject 2", etc., as requested.
- Replace placeholder notes, assets, and the index page with your real content.
