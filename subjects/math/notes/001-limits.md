# Limits (Introduction)

- Intuition: "What value does f(x) get close to as x approaches a?"
- Notation: `lim_{x→a} f(x) = L`
- Example: For `f(x) = (x^2-1)/(x-1)`, simplify to `x+1` (for x≠1), so limit at x=1 is 2.

Key rules
- Constant rule: lim c = c
- Sum rule: lim (f+g) = lim f + lim g
- Product rule: lim (fg) = (lim f)(lim g)
```
